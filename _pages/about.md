Hi! I'm a fourth year Physics and Astronomy student at University of Rochester. I'm also chapter founder and lead organizer of the [Rochester Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/rochester-ny/) satellite and member of the 2025 class of Astronaut Scholars. I'm originally from Cape Cod, MA, I'm an avid thrifter, and I have a cat named Princess Leia.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can Put a picture in: The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
