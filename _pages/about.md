Hi! I'm a fourth year Physics and Astronomy student at University of Rochester. I'm also chapter founder and lead organizer of the [Astronomy on Tap Rochester](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/rochester-ny/) satellite and member of the [Astronaut Scholar](https://www.astronautscholarship.org/) class of 2025. 

I'm currently working on my senior thesis with [Dr. Dominique Segura-Cox](https://www.seguracox.com/home) analyzing the kinematics of the asymmetric infalling streamer in young (Class 0) protostellar system Per-emb-2.

I'm originally from Cape Cod, MA, I'm an avid thrifter, and I enjoy reading mystery novels and fashion history.
